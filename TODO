# Code Clean-up Tasks for mvaring.c

## Low Priority

### Task 22: Consider adding debug/statistics support
- Add compile-time option to track statistics (total reads, writes, retries)
- Add validation checks for debug builds
- Consider adding ring_get_stats() function

# Completed Tasks

## rpi_adc_stream.c

### Task 1: Remove unused global variables and resolve TODOs [COMPLETED]
- Remove TODO comment on line 149 and make `g_pwm_range` a local variable where needed
- Remove TODO comment on line 151 and delete unused `g_fifo_size` global variable
- Update all references to `g_pwm_range` to use local variables or compute in place
- Status: Completed in commit 288d546dda48 (cleanup-todo-tasks branch)

### Task 2: Remove commented-out code blocks [COMPLETED]
- Remove commented code block lines 526-543 (old FIFO output format code)
- Remove commented code block lines 573-598 (old FIFO handling in do_streaming)
- Remove commented struct explanation lines 284-292 (redundant DMA_CB documentation)
- Status: Completed in commit 35bdddf79a67 (cleanup-todo-tasks branch)

### Task 3: Clean up dead FIFO-related code [COMPLETED]
- Removed all FIFO named pipe functionality
- Kept SPI hardware FIFO references (those are needed for hardware control)
- Status: Completed (cleanup-todo-tasks branch)

### Task 5: Define constants for magic numbers [COMPLETED]
- Create named constants for DMA channel assignments (DMA_CHAN_A, B, C values)
- Create constant for DMA priority configuration `(8<<24)|(1<<16)|(8<<8)|1`
- Replace magic numbers throughout the code with named constants
- Status: DMA channels already defined in rpi_dma_utils.h, SPI_DMA_PRIORITY added (cleanup-todo-tasks branch)

### Task 6: Improve error handling in fail() function [COMPLETED]
- Change `fail()` to accept formatted strings like printf
- Update calls to use fprintf(stderr, ...) for consistency
- Consider renaming to `fail_with_message()` for clarity
- Status: Completed - now uses variadic args and vfprintf (cleanup-todo-tasks branch)

### Task 7: Fix inconsistent global naming [OBSOLETE]
- Ensure all global variables use `g_` prefix consistently
- Review `g_fifo_name` (line 157) - already has prefix, verify others
- Status: g_fifo_name removed in Task 3, all remaining globals have g_ prefix

### Task 8: Remove commented variable declaration [COMPLETED]
- Remove `/*i,*/` comment on line 497 in adc_stream_csv() function
- Status: Completed (cleanup-todo-tasks branch)

### Task 9: Replace infinite sleep loop with graceful shutdown [COMPLETED]
- Lines 522-523: Replace `while(1) sleep(10);` with proper shutdown mechanism
- Consider setting a flag and breaking the main loop
- Add proper error message before terminating
- Status: Completed - waits for 'quit'/'q' command while preserving shared memory (cleanup-todo-tasks branch)

### Task 10: Clean up unused command-line options [OBSOLETE]
- Remove or implement `g_lockstep` functionality (parsed but not effectively used)
- Remove or implement `g_verbose` functionality (code is commented out on lines 536-541)
- Update help text or usage information if options are removed
- Status: Already completed as part of Task 3 - variables and options removed

## mvaring.c

### Task 11: Fix seqlock atomicity [COMPLETED]
- Change `r->writing` from plain `uint8_t` to `_Atomic uint8_t`
- Update mvaring.h line 24 to use atomic type
- Update all accesses to use atomic operations
- Increment MVARING_VERSION from 1 to 2
- Add performance note about frequent-write sub-optimality
- Status: Completed (cleanup-todo-tasks branch)
